# Introduction

For our project we will be creating a fantasy set dungeon crawler game. The game starts off with the 
player on the first level of the dungeon. The player will have to navigate through a series of tasks on 
each level. These tasks will include battling enemies, overcoming obstacles, and solving puzzles before 
they reach the end of the level. At the end of the level, the player will be required to defeat a final boss 
before they can move on to the next level.

As the player works their way through the map, new abilities and skills will be unlocked. For example, if 
you go from level one to level two, your strength will increase. We also plan on implementing a diverse 
range of skills for players to develop throughout the game. The skills will encompass abilities like 
combat, archery, and magic. Throughout the map there will also be items, like health packs and coins, 
for the player to pick up that will help them as they go along. With coins, players will be able to unlock 
skills they would normally develop through leveling up.

# Anticipated Technologies

The number one technology needed for this project will be RPG Makerer. Most game assets, like music, mapping, game mechanics,
and characters will come from RPG Maker itself. We will be using their pre-made assets for virtually everything. 
RPG Maker also uses JavaScript as a scripting language so that will have to be used
too for creating NPCs. For things like UI design and interfaces, we will rely on photoshop. 

# Method/Approach

We are splitting up responsibilites. Each level will be made one at a time. To ensure 
that nobody falls behind no member will move onto a next level until everybody has their part done. This means that
every member will work simultaneously on implementing the aspect that they are respobsible for every level made.

# Estimated Timeline

By the end of October we plan on having one level completely done and ready to go. This way we will have at least a working demo done for the midterm. After that we plan on being
being able to create at maybe 3-5 partially done levels for the final. Once we have the first level finished, we anticipate that we will be familiarized with the RPG Maker 
enough to start flying through the process.

# Anticipated Problems

Anticipated problems will include effectively communicating with all members of the group about progress
made on each memeber's responsibilities. Because there is 6 members of the group we are also concerned about scope creep 
by becoming too ambitious.
