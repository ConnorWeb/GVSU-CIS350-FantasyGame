Discussion points:

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Floor 3 just needs a few final tweaks
* Overhaul of NPC dialogue for ease of development imminent (Amber)
* Further implementation of NPC's
* Need more classes
* Perhaps we could start on a 4th floor soon
* Otherwise work on refining what we already have
